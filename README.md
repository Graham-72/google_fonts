# Google Fonts

This module enables you to add Google Fonts to your site using the 
Google Font API.

It is a port to BackdropCMS of the Drupal project, version 7.x-2.3.

This latest release 1.x-2.1.3 of the module for BackdropCMS adds 
an administrative setting for the Google Webfonts API Key which is 
needed for fetching an up-to-date listing of all available Google fonts.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

Visit the configuration page at 
Administration > Configuration > System > Google Fonts 
(admin/config/system/google_fonts) 
and enter the required information.

Please note that when fetching the listing of all available 
Google fonts this module stores the information in its config
file which then becomes large, nearly 900 kilobytes.
